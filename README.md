## Workshop Overview

This workshop is designed for beginners and intermediate practitioners in NLP. It provides a comprehensive introduction to the field, covering foundational concepts and practical applications. Participants will gain hands-on experience with text processing and embedding techniques, using Python-based libraries.

## Workshop Plan

### **Introduction**
- The evolution of NLP: From **ELIZA (1966)** to **ChatGPT (2022)**.
- Role of Regular Expressions (Regex) in simulating chatbots.

### **Text Preprocessing**
- Tokenization
  - Top-down (rule-based) tokenization.
  - Bottom-up tokenization.
- Normalization
  - Case folding.
  - Stemming and Lemmatization.
  - Handling corpora and word types.
  
### **Word Embeddings**
- Representing text as numerical vectors for machine learning tasks.
- Key embedding methods:
  - **Word2Vec**: Captures local context.
  - **GloVe**: Combines local context with global co-occurrence.
  - **FastText**: Utilizes character-level n-grams for subword representations.

### **Applications**
- Hands-on experience with **NLTK** and **spaCy** for implementing the concepts.
